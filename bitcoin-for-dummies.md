The term "Bitcoin" is polysemantic and could refer to the Bitcoin currency, the Bitcoin technology or the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin was launched in 2009, and has been at the forefront of financial and decentralization technology since then. Surprisingly, Bitcoin is a very clever amalgamation of ideas that  existed as far back as ten years before the introduction of Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is a close association between cryptography, distributed systems and economics, and this brings the diverse attention of cryptography experts, distributed systems experts, economists, and of course programmers to Bitcoin.
